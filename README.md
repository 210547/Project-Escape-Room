# If You Give a Mouse a Sandwich
This is an ["escape room"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_room) game made using Processing.js.  
It was originally made for the final project of my CPG3C class in high school, but includes a few bugs because the final version was lost.

Created and designed by both my friend, Tom Li, and I.  
I have decided that I will clean up the code (as it is super messy) and make some adjustments to make the game more playable.  

Name inspired by [If You Give a Mouse a Cookie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_You_Give_a_Mouse_a_Cookie).
