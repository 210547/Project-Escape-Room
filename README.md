# Escape-Room
This is an ["escape room"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_room) game made using p5.js.  
It was originally made for the final project of my CPG3C class in high school.  

Created and designed by both my friend, Tom Li, and I.  
I have decided that I will clean up the code (as it is super messy) and make some adjustments to make the game more playable.  

*(this repository was transferred from my old Github account that was used for class)*
