# If You Give a Mouse a Sandwich
This is an ["escape room"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_room) game made using Processing.js.  
It was originally made for the final project of my CPG3C class in high school.
Can be played ["here"](https://if-you-give-a-mouse-a-sandwich.herokuapp.com).

Created and designed by Steven Wong and Tom Li.

Name inspired by [If You Give a Mouse a Cookie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_You_Give_a_Mouse_a_Cookie).
